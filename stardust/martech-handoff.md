# Martech hand-off

Everything below is scaffolded **off**. To ship it, set `enabled: true` on `consent.cmp` and on each route in `stardust/martech-contract.json`, then re-run `deploy/scripts/martech-scaffold.mjs` and `dynamics/scripts/dynamics-check.mjs` to confirm the enabled tags load. Enabled tags load on `static-website.david-bosschaert.workers.dev` only; preview with `?martech=on` (add `&consent=accept` to grant every category).

## Consent

- **CMP:** none detected
- **Model `owner-decision`:** no evidence of consent gating inside the tag manager. Keep the source behaviour (route `category` null), or set a route `category` to a consent group id to load that tag manager only once the group is granted.
- **Categories:** no CMP configuration read — run `spec-martech.mjs` first, or decide categories with the owner.

## Routes

No tag-manager loader seen on the probed pages.

Also seen, not routed (loaded by the tag manager or inline on the source — confirm each still fires): marketing: ad / retargeting pixel.

## Rewrite before go-live

Nothing found (or no tag-manager library read).
